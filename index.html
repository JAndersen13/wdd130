            <p> Hello! My name is Joren Owens. I am from Phoenix, Arizona in the United States. I am a stay at home mom raising a very 
                happy and curious toddler. I enjoy reading, baking, and sewing, although my toddler likes to be involved with everything
                I do so that can be a little tough sometimes. Some of my favorite books are the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and anything from 
                Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere. My four other siblings are also big fans of the Cosmere and Lord of the Rings, and so we have 
                some good discussions about those. My toddler is a little small to be reading, but they love to pour over their little picture 
                books and so I imagine they will also be quite the reader once they are old enough. I love any type of desert with chocolate in
                it, as well as any fun and flavorful combinations. Lemon and raspberriese are one such example. As for the sewing, I make custom 
                adjustable skirts that fit well no matter how much weight you lose or gain. These skirts are especially great for pregnancy, and
                I am always ready to talk about how awesome these skirts are.</p>

            <h2> Arizona, United States </h2>
            <img src="images/arizona_state_flower.webp" alt="Arizona State Flower" >
            <p> The United States ranges from flat planes to towering mountains, from rain forests to deserts. The state of Arizona is well known for being such a desert, and is full of the tall saguaro cacti, whose blossom is the Arizona State flower.</p>
